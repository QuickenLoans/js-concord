# JS Concord Group

The JS Concord group is a group of developers striving for a more consistent
JavaScript project development experience.

This group will discuss and decide on "recommendations" for front-end JavaScript
development in an effort to eventually have a collection of standards that
projects can choose to follow for consistency.

No expectation is made that anyone will recognize this group as any sort of
authority or governing body in any way; any project, or team of people, which
chooses to follow the recommendations put forth by this group does so of, and
for, their own reasons.


# Recommendations

Concord Group Recommendations (CGRs) are merely one group's opinion on best
current practices in the industry and at the time of recommendation.


## Attribution

Much of the structure and approach have been inspired by [PHP Framework
Interoperability Group (PHP-FIG)].
